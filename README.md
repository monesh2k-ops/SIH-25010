## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Proposed Solution
Multilingual Support:

Deliver advisory in local Indian languages to overcome language barriers.

AI-Powered Personalization:

Use AI to provide customized guidance based on soil type, weather, crop history, and pest patterns.

Multiple Access Channels:

Reach farmers through mobile apps, voice calls (IVR), WhatsApp, and SMS — suitable for all literacy levels.

Offline & Low-Bandwidth Functionality:

Ensure tools work in areas with poor or no internet connectivity.

Real-Time, Location-Specific Insights:

Provide timely advice on crop selection, pest control, irrigation, and fertilizer use tailored to each farm.

Integration with Local Agri Experts:

Collaborate with local extension workers or agri-entrepreneurs for last-mile support and trust-building.

Soil and Weather Data Utilization:

Leverage satellite imagery, IoT, or low-cost soil testing kits for accurate advisory.

## Technical Approach
Collect soil, weather, and crop data from sensors, satellites, and APIs.

Use AI/ML to generate personalized crop, pest, and fertilizer advice.

Implement multilingual NLP for local language voice and text interaction.

Deliver recommendations via mobile app, WhatsApp, voice calls, and SMS.

Ensure offline and low-bandwidth functionality for rural connectivity.

Continuously improve advice using farmer feedback and data updates.

## Feasibility and Viability
Feasibility

Technical: Existing AI, NLP, and weather APIs make personalized advisory achievable. Multichannel delivery (voice, SMS, apps) is proven tech.

Operational: Partnerships with local agri-extension workers can aid last-mile reach and adoption.

Financial: Low-cost mobile and cloud technologies reduce initial investment and scale easily.

Social: Growing smartphone penetration and increasing digital literacy in rural India support adoption.

Viability

Market Need: Large base of small/marginal farmers urgently needs affordable, localized advisory.

Revenue Models: Subscription fees, pay-per-use, freemium models, or government/NGO partnerships for funding.

Impact: Improved yields and reduced input costs increase farmer income and environmental sustainability.

Scalability: Platform can expand across regions and crops by adding languages and data sources.

## Impact and Benefits
Increased Crop Yield: Personalized advice optimizes crop selection and care, boosting productivity.

Reduced Input Costs: Accurate guidance prevents overuse of fertilizers and pesticides, saving money.

Environmental Sustainability: Minimizes chemical overuse, protecting soil health and biodiversity.

Empowered Farmers: Access to real-time, local-language information improves decision-making.

Improved Livelihoods: Higher income and reduced losses enhance rural economic stability.

Digital Inclusion: Voice and SMS channels bridge the digital literacy gap for small farmers.

Scalable Model: Adaptable across regions, crops, and languages for widespread impact.
